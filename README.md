# image-classification
Classify images of [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) using TensorFlow.<br />
The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.<br />
The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a  simple convolutional neural network on all the samples.<br /> 
We'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer.<br />
At then end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.
